IMDb (an abbreviation of Internet Movie Database)[2] is an online database of information related to films, television series, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993. It is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.

As of March 2022, the database contained some 10.1 million titles (including television episodes) and 11.5 million person records.[3] Additionally, the site had 83 million registered users. The site's message boards were disabled in February 2017.
